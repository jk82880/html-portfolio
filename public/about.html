<h1>About Me</h1>
Hello! My name is James Kamau. I aspire to be a software developer. I have always wanted
to find a field within IT.<br>
As I have explored  different fields within IT, I found creating and maintaining
websites to be the most fun and awarding. <br> I have started with a web development course because it was
a good way for me to crack into and learn about software <br>development. I want to start with web development and ultimately
want to be a specialist in either software development <br> or in mobile development.

<P>
  I would love to find a job within the next year and not only finish this web development 
  that I am currently working on <br>but also a  mobile development course as well. As of now. I currently
  have Service Desk experience, customer service and <br> knowledgeable on Microsoft Office,
  IO, MacOS and WindowsOS.
