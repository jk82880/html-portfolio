<h1>The Best Movies According To James</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Star Wars V</h3>
<p>The perfect sequel. This move keeps you interested through the <br>
entire story with almost no slow parts or scenes that made you <br>
uninterested. There was a perfect blend of the protagonist, antagonist, <br>
twist and each factor that makes Star Wars. <br> 
</p>

<h3>Back To The Future 2</h3>
<p>One of the best time travel movies and use of past, future and present 
dystopia</p>

<h3>Spider-man No Way Home</h3>
<p>Spider-man is one of my favorite super heroes and this movies 
has all three actors <br> and the closest thing to get a collaboration
of all spiderman movies <br> </p>
